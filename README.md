**Data Analysis For SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up! by Shanil Lobanwala**

## Links to files

For this homework The first portion is *Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration*. The link to that directory is: [Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/climate_starter.ipynb). The second portion is *Step 2 - Climate App* and is located at: [Step 2 - Climate App](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/app.py). Finally the fun portion to see the data in a visual form was in the *Bonus* portion. That is located in the first Jupyter Notebook file. The *graphs* are located in [Images](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sqlalchemy-challenge/tree/main/Images). Here's the link to the [Instructor prompt](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/Instructor_README.md). Heres my analysis after working on the whole project:


### SQLAlchemy Analysis:

Hawaii does indeed have a very mild temperature throughout the whole year and seems like a very nice place to vacation. If we look at the graphs:

Clearly the frequency of temperatures is mostly in the 70s, however yes there is a decent amount of rain/precipitation each year. Just have to make sure to dodge the months that have a lot of rain each year when planning your trip.
